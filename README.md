1. About me
   - Hi, I’m @tabdroid-1 or just tabby
   - I’m interested in gamedev
   - I’m currently learning more about Unity

2. Projects
   - tabby cat(code name): 
       - canceled because i was using Unreal Engine and i relized it sucks.So i decided to use Unity because its lighter and faster.But i didnt know anything about Unity at that time.Also i want to mame as much game as posible so i can use them for university and stuff.But im sure i will start making this game in few years.I realy want to make this game.

   - Leave Nothing Behind: 
       - i will start making this game in few weeks.its a mini game.You have to kill every one.After you kill everyone you have to get rid of corpses and other stuff so you wont get caught.If you finish round you will earn money and you can spend them on ammos and weapons.If you die or get caught you will lose money.its a bit brutal but i dont realy care.idea sounds realy cool.(in dev)
